class LastItemPrediction(Scenario):
    """Predict a user's next interaction.

    Scenario frequently used in evaluation of sequential recommendation algorithms.

    .. warning::

        The scenario can only be used when the dataset has timestamp information,
        because the order of interactions is needed to correctly split the data.

    The scenario splits the data such that the last interaction of a user is the target for prediction,
    while the earlier ones are used for training and as history.

    - :attr:`full_training_data` contains all but the most recent
      interaction for each of the users.
    - :attr:`test_data_in`: contains the ``n_most_recent_in`` interactions before
      the last interaction of each user.
    - :attr:`test_data_out` contains the last interaction of all users.
    - :attr:`validation_training_data` contains all but the most recent interaction of
      each user in the full training dataset.
    - :attr:`validation_data_in` contains the ``n_most_recent_in`` interactions before
      the last interaction of each user in the full training dataset.
    - :attr:`validation_data_out` contains the most recent interaction
      of each user in the full training dataset
