    Computation of the similarity matrix is the same as normal ItemKNN.
    When predicting however the user's older interactions are given less weight in the final prediction score.

    .. math::

        \\text{sim}(u, i) = \\sum\\limits_{j \\in X_u} e^{-\\alpha \\cdot \\delta t_{u,j}} \\cdot \\text{sim}(i, j)

    Where :math:`\\alpha` is the `predict_decay` parameter.

    :param K: How many neigbours to use per item,
        make sure to pick a value below the number of columns of the matrix to fit on.
        Defaults to 200
    :type K: int, Optional
    :param predict_decay: Defines the decay scaling used for decay during prediction.
        Defaults to 1 / (24 * 3600).
        This means for every day since an interaction, the value of it will be divided by 'e'.
    :type predict_decay: float, optional
    :param similarity: Which similarity measure to use. Defaults to `"cosine"`.
        ``["cosine", "conditional_probability"]`` are supported.
    :type similarity: str, optional
