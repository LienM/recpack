    """Time aware variant of ItemKNN which uses an exponential decay function and cosine similarity.

    Algorithm as described in

    2010. Online evolutionary collaborative filtering.

    The algorithm uses an exponential decay function:

    .. math::

        \\Gamma(x) = e^{- \\alpha \\cdot \\text{x}}

    where :math:`\\alpha` is the decay scaling parameter,
    and x is the time between the maximal timestamp in the matrix
    and the timestamp of the event.

    Similarity is computed on this weighted matrix, using cosine similarity.
    At prediction time a user's history is weighted using the same formula with a different alpha.
    This weighted history is then multiplied with the precomputed similarity matrix.

    :param K: How many neigbours to use per item,
        make sure to pick a value below the number of columns of the matrix to fit on.
        Defaults to 200
    :type K: int, optional
    :param fit_decay: Defines the decay scaling used for decay during model fitting.
        Defaults to 1 / (24 * 3600).
        This means for every day since an interaction, the value of it will be divided by 'e'.
    :type fit_decay: float, optional
    :param predict_decay: Defines the decay scaling used for decay during prediction.
        Defaults to 1 / (24 * 3600).
        This means for every day since an interaction, the value of it will be divided by 'e'.
