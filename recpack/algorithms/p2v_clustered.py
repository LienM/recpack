    E-commerce in Your Inbox: Product Recommendations at Scale
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07154)

    Products with similar embeddings are grouped into clusters
    using Kmeans clustering.
    Product recommendations are made only from the top-Kcl related clusters.
    A cluster is considered related if users often consume an item
    from this cluster after the item.
    Clusters are ranked based on the probability
    that an interaction with an item from cluster ci is followed by an
    interaction with an item from cluster cj.
    Products from these top clusters are sorted by their cosine similarity.

    Where possible, defaults were taken from the paper.

    :param num_components: The size of the embedding vectors for both input and output embeddings, defaults to 300
    :type num_components: int, optional
    :param num_negatives: Number of negative samples for every positive sample, defaults to 10
    :type num_negatives: int, optional
    :param window_size: Size of the context window to the left and to the right of the target item
         used in skipgram negative sampling, defaults to 2
    :type window_size: int, optional
    :param stopping_criterion: Used to identify the best model computed thus far.
        The string indicates the name of the stopping criterion.
        Which criterions are available can be found at StoppingCriterion.FUNCTIONS
        Defaults to 'precision'
    :type stopping_criterion: str, optional
    :param K: How many neigbours to use per item,
        make sure to pick a value below the number of columns of the matrix to fit on.
        Defaults to 200
    :type K: int, optional
    :param num_clusters: Number of clusters for Kmeans clustering, defaults to 5
    :type num_clusters: int, optional
    :param Kcl: Maximum number of top-K clusters recommendations can be made from, defaults to 2
    :type Kcl: int, optional
    :param batch_size: Batch size for Adam optimizer. Higher batch sizes make each epoch more efficient,
        but increases the amount of epochs needed to converge to the optimum,
        by reducing the amount of updates per epoch. Defaults to 1000
    :type batch_size: int, optional
    :param learning_rate: Learning rate, defaults to 0.01
    :type learning_rate: float, optional
    :param clipnorm: Clips gradient norm.
        The norm is computed over all gradients together,
        as if they were concatenated into a single vector, defaults to 1
    :type clipnorm: int, optional
    :param max_epochs: Maximum number of epochs (iterations), defaults to 10
    :type max_epochs: int, optional
    :param stop_early: If True, early stopping is enabled,
        and after ``max_iter_no_change`` iterations where improvement of loss function
        is below ``min_improvement`` the optimisation is stopped,
        even if max_epochs is not reached.
        Defaults to False
    :type stop_early: bool, optional
    :param max_iter_no_change: If early stopping is enabled,
        stop after this amount of iterations without change.
        Defaults to 5
    :type max_iter_no_change: int, optional
    :param min_improvement: If early stopping is enabled, no change is detected,
        if the improvement is below this value.
        Defaults to 0.0
    :type min_improvement: float, optional
    :param seed: Seed for random sampling. Useful for reproducible results,
        defaults to None
    :type seed: int, optional
    :param save_best_to_file: If true, the best model will be saved after training.
        Defaults to False
    :type save_best_to_file: bool, optional
    :param replace: Sample with or without replacement
        (see :class:`recpack.algorithms.samplers.PositiveNegativeSampler` ), defaults to False
    :type replace: bool, optional
    :param exact: If False (default) negatives are checked against the corresponding positive sample only,
        allowing for (rare) collisions. If collisions should be avoided at all costs,
        use exact = True, but suffer decreased performance. Defaults to False
    :type exact: bool, optional
    :param keep_last: Retain last model,
        rather than best (according to stopping criterion value on validation data), defaults to False
    :type keep_last: bool, optional
    :param distribution: Which distribution to use to sample negatives. Options are `["uniform", "unigram"]`.
        Uniform distribution will sample all items equally likely.
        Unigram distribution puts more weight on popular items. Defaults to "uniform"
    :type distribution: str, optional
    :param validation_sample_size: Amount of users that will be sampled to calculate
        validation loss and stopping criterion value.
        This reduces computation time during validation, such that training times are strongly reduced.
        If None, all nonzero users are used. Defaults to None.
    :type validation_sample_size: int, optional
