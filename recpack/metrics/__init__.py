"""

The metrics module in recpack contains a large amount of metrics
commonly used to evaluate recommendation algorithms.

All metrics assume that we have access to a set ``y_true`` of true
user interactions that we are trying to predict and a set of
recommendation scores ``y_pred``.
We can then evaluate how well our algorithm was able to predict
these interactions in ``y_true``.

Most metrics are "Top-K Metrics": they consider
only the Top-K best scoring item predictions, as the number of
recommendations that can be shown in a realistic setting
is limited.

Global Metrics
---------------

A global metric reports only a single, global metric value.

    CoverageK
    PercentileRanking

Listwise Metrics
----------------

A listwise metric reports one metric value for every user.
To obtain a global metric value, these per-user scores are averaged.

    DCGK
    NDCGK
    RecallK
    CalibratedRecallK
    PrecisionK
    ReciprocalRankK

Elementwise Metric
------------------

An elementwise metric reports a score for every user-item pair in the Top-K.
To obtain a global metric value, these scores are summed per user, then averaged.
